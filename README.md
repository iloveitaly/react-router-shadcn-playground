# React Router + Shadcn Playground

Having a simple playground template, well structured for LLM instructions, is key to rapid iteration: especially when prototyping new UIs.

## Usage

Get started with copier:

```shell
uv tool run copier@latest copy --trust \
  https://github.com/iloveitaly/react-router-shadcn-playground \
  your-project-name
```

## StackBlitz

I originally got excited about the idea of playgrounds by playing around with StackBlitz.  This [doesn't currently work on StackBlitz](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core/issues/560#issuecomment-2611279611) because the required node version is 20.

I've since migrated to primarily using a combination of VS Code and Cursor to do AI UI prototyping, which is what works best with this repository.
