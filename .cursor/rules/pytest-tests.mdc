## Pytest Tests

- Look to tests/factories.py to generate any required database state
  - Here's an example of how to create + persist a factory `DistributionFactory.build().save()`
- Use the `faker` factory to generate emails, etc.
- Do not mock or patch unless I instruct you to. Test as much of the application stack as possible in each test.
